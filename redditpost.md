# Unified AppSync dynamic library for iOS 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.

* AppSync Unified is **NOT** for piracy.

* AppSync Unified is for **freedom of iOS development with the official Xcode iOS SDK.**

* Jailbreaking is **NOT** for piracy.

* Jailbreaking is for **freedom of your iOS device.**

AppSync Unified is a tweak that patches `installd` to allow for the installation of unsigned, fakesigned, or ad-hoc signed IPA packages on an iOS device.

AppSync Unified can be used to downgrade or clone installed apps, to download fakesigned IPAs (often emulators), and also to assist in the development of iOS applications using Xcode.

**AppSync Unified should not be used to pirate iOS apps. Please support iOS app developers and do not pirate!**

**I explain the problem with AppSync Unified and iOS piracy rather thoroughly [in this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3oovnh/discussion_regarding_appsync_unified_ios_9_and/). Please give it a read.**
